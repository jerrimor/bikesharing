In the Checkout Times for Users image, it is apparent that the longer the period of time a customer has checked out a bike, the amount of bikes 
sharply increases.  At the end of a two hour mark, the utilization peaks.

Within the Trips by Weekday per Hour image, the illustration shows that the peak times for renting a bike are around the 8 am hour and close to the end of 
a workday at 5 pm, Monday through Friday.  Weekends appear to have a constant flow of users between 10 am and 6 pm.

In the Trips by Gender heatmap, there is a strong use of bikes by Males vs Females.  And it would seem the males are using these bikes during the already 
discovered peak hours of 8 am and 5 pm, Monday through Friday.

User Trips by Gender by Weekday heatmap shares the data that Males utilize the bike service most and they do so between Monday through Friday.  In this
heatmap, it is also evident that these male customers are more likely to be subscribers.

This pie chart, titled 'Customers' is a great display that shows the majority of customers are subscribers.  1.9 million, of the 2.3 million that use the
bike sharing service are subscribers.

August Peak Hours is a horizontal bar chart that shares the information that there are several users of the bikes within the month of August.  The 
summer weather helps keep the bikes busy.  



# Summary
The results of this analysis indicate that a bike ride sharing concept is a popular venture that could be very profitable in Des Moines, IA. The data shows that 
males are the primmary customers with this type of business and that they tend to be subsribers instead of one time users.  The males utilize the service
most in the warm, summer months such as August and rent most while getting to or leaving from work.  That is proven with the data that shows the most 
popular timeframe for rentals is at or near the 8:00 am hour and at or near the 5:00 pm hour of the weekday, Monday through Friday.    
The charts have brought forth quite a bit of factual information from the dataset however I would also run additional visualizations and analysis.  One other test I 
would perform would be to compare the age of the customer to the type of customer so that it might be found that the younger generation are the subscribers. If the majority of subscribers were younger than it would ideal for this business concept because
they would be long term customers.  A second form of analysis that I would like to run is to create a map of the start and stop stations to illustrate what 
routes are most popular and to identify where in Des Moines, IA this concept would be the most successful. That would be helpful information while setting
up bike stations, as well.
