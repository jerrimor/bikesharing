# Overview of Bike Sharing Analysis

Data analysis was performed on a dataset from a bike sharing business that is successful and running in New York City.  This analysis is to determine if it  
is a viable project for the city of Des Moines,IA.  Tableau is the tool that was used for this analysis to assist in displaying the results.  Several 
worksheets were created and a story to illustrate and share results and data.  


## Results

The complete story is listed below as a link in Tableau Public.  The link shares the story created with several worksheets to confirm the success of the

## Summary
The results of this analysis indicate that a bike ride sharing concept is a popular venture that could be very profitable in Des Moines, IA.  I would also run 
additional visualizations and analysis.  One other test I would perform would be to compare the age of the customer to the type of customer so that it might
be found that the younger generation are the subscribers. If the majority of subscribers were younger than it would ideal for this business concept because
they would be long term customers.  A second form of analysis that I would like to run is to create a map of the start and stop stations to illustrate what 
routes are most popular and to identify where in Des Moines, IA this concept would be the most successful.
